DIDs enable creators to revoke VCs if licensing terms are violated.
VCs can restrict use to specific platforms or users, enforcing copyright restrictions.
Using DIDs, creators can publish copyright status publicly to alert potential users.
VCs linked to DIDs allow content owners to enforce selective copyright permissions.
VCs provide proof of license expiration, notifying licensees when their rights end.
Both can prevent fake or unauthorized use of content in secondary markets.
VCs serve as proof of payment, documenting royalties or licensing fees.
They enable micro-licensing, permitting partial or limited use of copyrighted content.
DIDs protect creators’ rights by decentralizing copyright enforcement.
Creators can manage usage rights by issuing new VCs for different content uses.
DIDs help prevent misuse by tracking all versions of the original content.
VCs offer a way to automate copyright renewal or extensions digitally.
Both DIDs and VCs enable revocable access, safeguarding against improper usage.
They provide a system for re-issuing licenses or permissions with updated terms.
By verifying ownership via DIDs, content creators can reduce piracy and unauthorized use.
41–60: Verification of Licensing Terms
VCs allow easy verification of licensing terms, simplifying copyright management.
Licensees can confirm their rights with VCs, ensuring no conflicts with copyright owners.
DIDs ensure that licensing VCs are only issued by verified rights holders.
VCs hold licensing terms that prevent unlawful use beyond agreed-upon terms.
By storing licensing VCs in digital wallets, users have ready access to their rights.

Both DIDs and VCs improve tracking of licensing terms across different jurisdictions.
They simplify royalty distribution by confirming exact usage rights.
VCs enable creators to define digital rights, like resale or adaptation rights, clearly.
DID-backed VCs ensure compliance by clearly outlining copyright limitations.
Creators can enforce attribution rights in licensing terms through DIDs.
VCs ensure licensees adhere to territorial restrictions set by copyright holders.
Copyright agreements stored as VCs reduce the risk of license misunderstandings.
By automating terms with VCs, creators can enforce usage rights efficiently.
DIDs can be used to issue VCs for limited-time or single-use rights.
VCs support version control for updated copyright terms, ensuring compliance.
VCs verify re-licensing terms, allowing secondary creators to check their usage limits.
DIDs and VCs prevent fraudulent use of license copies, ensuring authenticity.
VCs enable creators to maintain full control over derivative rights for adaptations.
DID-based VCs help licensees understand usage limits, lowering copyright disputes.
61–80: Dispute Resolution and Proof of Ownership
DIDs simplify ownership verification, minimizing copyright disputes.
VCs provide strong evidence in legal copyright disputes by linking to creators’ DIDs.
Both DIDs and VCs document authorship and creation date for proof of originality.
DIDs allow creators to make public copyright claims, deterring counterclaims.
VCs establish an immutable record that creators can present in copyright cases.
Copyright disputes can reference DID and VC records for impartial verification.
DIDs simplify proving ownership, especially in digital-only works.
VCs enable creators to show proof of originality without expensive copyright litigation.
DID-based VCs create a paperless trail for ownership, making rights clear.
VCs can be updated with legal outcomes, like judgments in favor of the owner.
Both DIDs and VCs support arbitration processes by tracking the work’s lineage.
They reduce the need for costly legal intervention by clearly defining ownership.
VCs enable independent validation of copyright claims in cross-border disputes.
DIDs enable quick validation of ownership by courts and other legal entities.
VCs provide a clear record, strengthening cases against unauthorized duplication.
DIDs create a system where ownership is as transparent as a physical signature.
VCs can store digital evidence of copyright registration and past licensing.
DIDs make it harder for infringers to claim “unknown ownership” in defense.
VCs support collaborative works by listing co-owners or joint copyright holders.
DIDs and VCs prevent fake or fraudulent copyright claims by verifying origin.
