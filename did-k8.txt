Comprehensive list of 100 facts about the relationship between Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), covering their uses, benefits, and technical aspects:

General Relationship
DIDs are a digital form of identification, while VCs are digital statements that can be verified.
DIDs and VCs are both foundational elements in decentralized identity ecosystems.
DIDs provide the identifier, and VCs provide the proof of information or claims.
VCs are often associated with DIDs to ensure data authenticity and secure verification.
Together, DIDs and VCs allow users to prove claims without relying on centralized authorities.
DIDs can refer to an individual, organization, or even an object within a VC.
VCs can contain multiple claims, each potentially verified by a different DID.
Both DIDs and VCs are part of W3C's standards for decentralized identity.
Technical Foundation
DIDs are cryptographically generated and verifiable.
DIDs and VCs are stored on decentralized networks like blockchains or IPFS.
Each DID resolves to a DID Document containing metadata for verification.
VCs are signed with private keys linked to a DID for authenticity.
Both DIDs and VCs use public-key infrastructure (PKI) for security.
Cryptographic algorithms like RSA or ECC are commonly used in DIDs and VCs.
DIDs often include pointers to VCs, making them traceable and verifiable.
Verifiable Credential standards allow for selective disclosure to protect privacy.
DIDs and VCs both support zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy.
Use Cases and Applications
DIDs and VCs are used in self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems.
They are foundational for decentralized identity verification in Web3.
DIDs and VCs support cross-platform digital identity management.
They are used in educational certifications, providing tamper-proof records.
VCs attached to DIDs can be used for digital passports and travel documents.
They can verify credentials for employment, such as degrees or certifications.
Health records are secured and verified using DIDs and VCs.
They enable digital voting systems, proving voter eligibility without revealing identity.
VCs can confirm age or legal status without disclosing personal details.
DIDs and VCs power KYC (Know Your Customer) processes in finance.
They enable portable, verifiable digital IDs for refugees or stateless persons.
VCs enable sharing of medical qualifications or licenses.
Government-issued VCs can serve as official digital ID cards.
They can provide proof of address through verified utility bills.
DIDs help manage IoT identities, linking VCs to devices.
They are used in proof-of-membership systems for clubs or organizations.
Digital tickets for events can be verified through VCs.
VCs enhance supply chain transparency by verifying source and quality.
DIDs and VCs enable verification of professional achievements in the gig economy.
Privacy and Security
DIDs protect privacy by decentralizing personal identifiers.
VCs allow users to share only necessary information selectively.
They support consent-based information sharing with third parties.
DIDs and VCs minimize data breaches by limiting reliance on centralized databases.
They are resistant to phishing attacks, as DIDs don’t rely on usernames/passwords.
Users retain control over their data, enhancing trust and autonomy.
VCs can be revoked, ensuring that invalid credentials are unusable.
Both can be implemented to comply with GDPR and privacy laws.
They support pseudonymity, masking the DID holder’s true identity.
DIDs prevent identity theft by verifying ownership through cryptographic proofs.
VCs reduce the need for centralized verification authorities.
Interoperability and Standards
DIDs and VCs adhere to W3C standards, ensuring global compatibility.
They are compatible with various blockchain and non-blockchain platforms.
Different DID methods (e.g., did
, did
) support various use cases.
W3C's VC data model ensures VCs are interpretable across platforms.
They enable cross-border verification of identities.
Many digital wallets support DIDs and VCs, enhancing interoperability.
DIDs can be integrated with OpenID Connect for Web2 and Web3 compatibility.
VCs are compatible with several metadata schemas, like JSON-LD and JWT.
Blockchain Integration
Many DID solutions are implemented on blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.
Blockchain networks store DID Documents for decentralized verification.
VCs can be anchored to blockchains for immutable proof of issuance.
DIDs and VCs leverage smart contracts for automated credential issuance.
Privacy-focused blockchains enable DIDs and VCs to secure data without exposure.
They allow for on-chain and off-chain verification, balancing cost and privacy.
VCs issued on blockchains create a transparent record of credential issuance.
Layer 2 solutions make DID and VC usage more scalable and affordable.
Enterprise and Business Applications
Companies can issue employee IDs as DIDs linked to VCs.
DIDs and VCs enable secure customer onboarding without passwords.
They allow businesses to verify vendors or contractors through VCs.
DIDs and VCs improve trust and transparency in supplier relationships.
Companies can reduce fraud by verifying user identities with DIDs.
They streamline cross-company verification of employment credentials.
VCs ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
Companies can verify age restrictions for specific products or services.
DID-based VC verification enhances cybersecurity for corporate networks.
DIDs allow organizations to issue digital access credentials for facilities.
Education and Certification
Educational institutions issue VCs for diplomas and transcripts.
VCs can prove enrollment status, enhancing trust in education.
DIDs ensure lifelong access to verified educational records.
Professional licenses can be issued as VCs and linked to DIDs.
VCs improve efficiency in verifying international educational credentials.
They allow for digital badges, demonstrating skills and achievements.
VCs can track continuing education credits for professionals.
Healthcare Applications

VCs enable portable health credentials, useful for remote healthcare.
DIDs protect patient privacy in digital health systems.
Health professionals can share qualifications as VCs for credential verification.
DIDs support cross-institutional data sharing with patient consent.
They allow for tamper-proof storage of vaccination records.
User-Centric Design and Control
DIDs and VCs give users control over their digital identities.
They minimize the need for users to remember passwords.
Users can share information with granular privacy settings.
They enable decentralized data ownership in the digital economy.
DIDs support revocation of VCs by the credential holder.
Users can carry their credentials across different ecosystems.
VCs reduce reliance on traditional ID cards or physical documents.
