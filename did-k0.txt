DIDs are a new type of identifier that enable verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities.
DIDs are created by their owners, not by centralized authorities like governments or corporations.
Decentralization is a core principle of DID technology, designed to prevent reliance on any single entity.
DIDs can be stored on a blockchain, but they can also reside in other decentralized systems.
A DID Document is the associated metadata that describes a DID.
DID Documents are machine-readable, providing public information about the DID.
DID Documents contain cryptographic keys for secure verification.
DID Documents also contain service endpoints that direct how to interact with the DID.
W3C has defined the DID specification, making it a web standard.
DIDs are part of the broader Web 3.0 movement for a more user-centric internet.
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is the concept behind DIDs, emphasizing user control.
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) often work alongside DIDs to authenticate identity claims.
Each DID is globally unique, even without a central authority.
DIDs are structured as URIs, similar to website URLs.
A DID could look like this: did:example:123456789abcdefghi.
The method in the DID URI (e.g., example) specifies how it’s implemented.
DID methods define how to create, read, update, and deactivate a DID.
Different blockchains may support different DID methods.
DID Resolvers allow software to locate and interpret DID Documents.
A DID Controller manages the creation and updates of the DID.
DIDs are cryptographically secure and prevent tampering.
DIDs promote privacy by minimizing data exposure.
DIDs enhance security by preventing single points of failure.
DIDs support the concept of a “user-owned internet.”
Users can rotate cryptographic keys in their DID without changing the DID itself.
DIDs enable cross-platform digital identity solutions.
With DIDs, users control who can access their identity information.
DIDs are typically associated with a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private).
DID Documents can be stored on various decentralized storage systems, not just blockchains.
Service endpoints in DID Documents can be used for interactions such as messaging.
DIDs can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) for verifying identity.
Governments and organizations are exploring DIDs for digital credentials.
DIDs can reduce identity fraud by providing secure, verifiable identifiers.
DID Auth is a way for users to authenticate with a DID instead of a username and password.
DID Comm is a protocol for secure messaging using DIDs.
DIDs are interoperable with a range of digital wallets.
DIDs are resilient, as they don’t rely on any single server.
DIDs can protect users’ identities in virtual worlds and metaverses.
DID methods are registered and published on DID Method Registries.
Public keys in DID Documents allow others to verify the authenticity of the DID owner.
DIDs support selective disclosure, revealing only relevant identity information.
DIDs can be updated or revoked as needed by the DID controller.
DIDs can link to IoT devices for secure, decentralized IoT management.
DIDs are compatible with mobile and web applications.
Each DID Document has a unique DID URL.
Decentralized Identifiers enable digital signatures for verifiable transactions.
DIDs don’t require a third party for issuing identifiers.
DID methods may require fees if hosted on certain blockchains.
DIDs support multi-factor authentication in decentralized systems.
DIDs can simplify compliance with data privacy regulations.
DIDs provide data minimization, revealing only essential data.
A DID Document may list multiple service endpoints.
Users can hold multiple DIDs for different contexts (e.g., work, social).
DIDs can be used in healthcare to verify credentials of practitioners.
DIDs support zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification.
DIDs are immutable, but DID Documents are mutable.
DID Controllers can delegate rights to other entities.
DIDs are part of the self-sovereign identity movement.
DID Standards are set by organizations like W3C and DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation).
DIDs can use multiple cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA and Elliptic Curve.
DIDs can be associated with biometric data in some systems.
DIDs allow organizations to issue digital certificates.
DIDs reduce reliance on passwords by leveraging cryptography.
DIDs can be used in e-commerce to verify customer identities.
DIDs are often stored in digital wallets.
DIDs allow users to revoke access to their identity data.
DIDs can be used in voting systems for secure digital elections.
DIDs support cross-border identity verification.
DIDs allow persistent identities in a decentralized world.
DIDs provide a framework for trusted data exchange.
DID networks like Sovrin and Ethereum support decentralized identity solutions.
DIDs allow organizations to implement BYOI (Bring Your Own Identity).
DIDs are compatible with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
DID URLs enable selective access to DID Documents.
DIDs enable proof of personhood without revealing PII.
DIDs can integrate with smart contracts on blockchains.
DID-based authentication can secure sensitive digital transactions.
DIDs can establish trusted identity ecosystems.
DIDs allow users to verify reputation data across networks.
DIDs enable cross-application identity portability.
DIDs can eliminate fake profiles by providing proof of real identity.
DIDs enable privacy-preserving advertising.
DID wallets store DIDs, credentials, and private keys.
DID-backed reputation systems are more resistant to tampering.
DID Methods are implemented in code and registered openly.
DIDs can be connected to IoT for device-to-device authentication.
DIDs are being tested in telecommunications for customer verification.
DID standards are evolving, with new features regularly added.
DIDs are machine-readable, enabling seamless automation.
DIDs allow for peer-to-peer verification.
